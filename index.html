        <h1>Mandatory Training</h1>
        <div class="gold-bar"></div>

        <p><b>Mandatory training is defined as a type of educational or instructional program that individuals 
            are required to complete</b> as part of their role or membership in an organization. This training 
            is critical for effective job performance and institutional safety. Mandatory training is limited 
            to training that complies with Board of Regents (BOR), Georgia Tech, state and federal policies, 
            regulations and laws.</p>

        <p>Per University System of Georgia (USG) policy, all mandatory training required by the Institution 
            must be approved by Institution's Chief Human Resources Officer ("CHRO") and the Institution's President. 
            No Institution training may include affirmations, ideological tests, or oaths (including diversity 
            statements). Additionally individual units and departments are not permitted to mandate training for 
            departmental employees beyond that approved by the Institution's president and CHRO as outlined below.</p>

        <p>Mandatory employee training should be limited to that which complies with Board of Regents (BOR), state, 
            and federal policies, regulations, and laws. Examples of appropriate topics for training include:</p>

        <ul class="criteria-list">
            <li>Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</li>
            <li>Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.</li>
            <li>Functional training required for the performance of an individual job.</li>
            <li>Best practices related to an employee's engagement and communication.</li>
            <li>Any requirements encompassed with this HRAP on General Criteria for Employment.</li>
        </ul>
